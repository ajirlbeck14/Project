## Background
Goal is to use Data to Help Cow/Calf Producers Make Better Management Decisions to Increase Profitability

* Extremely volatile and uncertain markets for agricultural commodities
  * Unexpected weather
  * Global politics
* Many cow/calf producers today don’t have records of their operation
  * Time / Other priorities
  * Numerous variables making it difficult to be organized
* Factors on Profitability
  * Weather Patterns  :x:

## Project Workflow
Here you can see a brief layout of how we intend
to accomplish our project for ABE 516X this semester


![Project Workflow](516-Project.png "WorkFlow")


## Topics Relevant to ABE 516X 
Incorporation of topics relevant to this class  - what from the class did you use in this project and why might it be useful for research projects like this?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  Were there any assumptions or transformations needed?



## Automate and Reproduce Analysis
Ability to automate and reproduce your analysis (if the file input were to change, could this analysis be reproduced and how easily?)  - how will someone else reproduce this analysis?  Is the data stored somewhere?  Can I reproduce the figures easily?



## Assignment
Creation of one assignment based on your dataset for the class to complete - one can think of this of a task or homework assignment based on your project.
