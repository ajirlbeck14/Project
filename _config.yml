description: CattleTEC market forecasting and analysis project. The goal of this project is to bring in commodity values that matter to cow / calf producers and display them in a quick and easy to understand format that allows the user to refine and select what timeframe of the markets they would like to explore. In addition, we are also developing a machine learning algorithm that will analyze the commodity trends from previous years, in order to forecast out what the markets will do before they occur. This will give farmers a competitive advantage when marketing their livestock.
